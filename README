# Purpose
Detection EMG activation (effectively turning EMG into binary 0/1 signal) with thresolding

# Usage
The function EMG_to_binary_signal in file EMG_burst.py does the main work.

## Input arguments:
signal: a n*1 numpy array for original EMG signal
time: a numpy (also n*1) array corresponding timestamp (unit: sec)
ref: a 2-element list for referncing "no muscle activation period"
Fs: sampling frequency
ma_dur: duration for moving average (unit: sec)
  -> The larger ma_dur the smoother tkeo, but the signal will be more "off"
thr_sig: the threshold is mean absolute tkeo during "ref" plus thr_sig times std of it.
  -> The larger thr_sig, the more strict threshold is.
bp_filt = True | False for optional bandpass pre-filtering before TKEO
bp_filt_low = low limit for BP
bp_filt_high = high limit for BP

## Output:
A python dictionary containing:
'binary_signal': final binary signal, 
'processed_signal': filtered signal, 
'tkeo': tkeo itself, 
'rect_smo_tkeo': rectified and smoothed (by moving average) tkeo

## Example
Please refer to test.py and test.csv
